## Exercise 3: Monitoring and logging in Azure

Duration: 40 minutes

Fabrikam Medical Conferences has its first website for a customer running in the cloud, but deployment is still a largely manual process, and we have no insight into the behavior of the application in the cloud.

### Task 1: Set up Application Insights

1. Open the `deploy-appinsights.ps1` PowerShell script in the `C:\Workspaces\lab\mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files\infrastructure` folder of your lab files GitHub repository and replace studentprefix value with **<inject key="Deploymentid" />** on the first line.

    ```pwsh
    $studentsuffix = "Your 3 letter abbreviation here"                                  # <-- Modify this
    $resourcegroupName = "fabmedical-rg-" + $studentsuffix
    $location1 = "westeurope"
    $appInsights = "fabmedicalai-" + $studentsuffix
    ```

2. Navigate back to the PowerShell terminal and run the below mentioned command:

    ```
    ./deploy-appinsights.ps1
    ```
    
3. Now save the `AI Instrumentation Key` specified in the output - we will need it for a later step.

    ```bash
    The installed extension 'application-insights' is in preview.
    AI Instrumentation Key="55cade0c-197e-4489-961c-51e2e6423ea2"
    ```

4. Navigate to the `./content-web` folder in your GitHub lab files repository by running the below mentioned command.

   ```
   cd ..
   ```
   
5. Now execute the following command to install JavaScript support for Application Insights via NPM to the web application frontend.

    ```bash
    npm install applicationinsights --save
    ```

6. Modify the file `./content-web/app.js` to reflect the following to add and configure Application Insights for the web application frontend in the local folder.

    ```js
    const express = require('express');
    const http = require('http');
    const path = require('path');
    const request = require('request');

    const app = express();

    const appInsights = require("applicationinsights");         // <-- Add these lines here
    appInsights.setup("55cade0c-197e-4489-961c-51e2e6423ea2");  // <-- Make sure AI Inst. Key matches
    appInsights.start();                                        // <-- key from step 2.

    app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'dist/content-web')));
    const contentApiUrl = process.env.CONTENT_API_URL || "http://localhost:3001";

    ...
    ```

7. Add and commit changes to your GitHub lab-files repository. From the root of the repository, execute the following:

    ```pwsh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Added Application Insights"
    git push
    ```

8. Wait for the GitHub Actions for your lab files repository to complete before executing the next step.

9. Redeploy the web application by running the below commands:

    ```
    cd C:\Workspaces\lab\mcw-continuous-delivery-lab-files\infrastructure
    ./deploy-webapp.ps1
    ```
    
10. Visit the deployed website and check Application Insights in the Azure Portal to see instrumentation data.

### Task 2: Continuous Deployment with GitHub Actions

 1. Go to Environment details click on **Service principle Credentials** copy **Application id(clientId)** , **clientSecret** , **subscriptionId** and **tenantId** 
    
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/AIW-DevOps/main/Assets/sp-creds-auth.png)
    
    Replace the values that you copied in below Json.
    ```pwsh
    {
        "clientId": "...",
        "clientSecret": "...",
        "subscriptionId": "...",
        "tenantId": "...",
        "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
        "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "https://management.azure.com/",
        "activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "https://graph.windows.net/",
        "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net:8443/",
        "galleryEndpointUrl": "https://gallery.azure.com/",
        "managementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net/"
    }
    ```
    Copy the complete JSON output to your clipboard.

2. In your GitHub lab files repository, navigate to the `Secrets` > `Actions` blade in the `Settings` tag and create a new repository secret named `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`. Paste the JSON output copied in the previous step to the secret value and click on `Add secret`.

    ![](media/azurecred.png)

3. Navigate to **deploy-webapp.ps1** file within the infrastructure folder and verfiy that **Student prefix** with **<inject key="Deploymentid" />** and **githubAccount** with your GitHub username is updated. If not update them and **Commit** the changes.
 
    ![The `New workflow` button in the repository GitHub Actions tab.](media/update5.png "GitHub Actions")  

4. Add a new GitHub Action workflow in your GitHub lab files repository by selecting the `Actions` tab and selecting `New workflow`. 

    ![The `New workflow` button in the repository GitHub Actions tab.](media/hol-ex3-task2-step1-1.png "GitHub Actions")  

5. Select the `Set up a workflow yourself` and call the new YAML file `docker-publish.yml`.

    ![The Choose a workflow options are listed and the link to set up a workflow yourself is highlighted for emphasis.](media/hol-ex3-task2-step5-1.png "GitHub Actions")

6. Open the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CloudLabs-MCW/MCW-Continuous-delivery-in-Azure-DevOps/prod/Hands-on%20lab/docker-publish.yml` link, copy the code and replace the code in the code block. Make sure to change the student prefix with **<inject key="Deploymentid" />** for the last action in the `build` job.

7. Commit the YAML file to your `main` branch. A GitHub action should begin to execute for the new workflow.

    >**Note**: Make sure that your Actions workflow file does not contain any syntax errors, which may appear when you copy and paste. They are highlighted in the editor or when the Action tries to run, as shown below.

    ![GitHub Actions workflow file syntax error.](./media/github-actions-workflow-file-error.png "Syntax error in Actions workflow file")

8. Observe that the action builds the docker images, pushes them to the container registry, and deploys them to the Azure web application.

    ![GitHub Action detail reflecting Docker ](media/hol-ex3-task2-step8-1.png "GitHub Action detail")

9. Navigate to PowerShell terminal and run the command `git pull` on your local repository folder to fetch the latest changes from GitHub.

### Task 3: Continuous Deployment with Azure DevOps Pipelines

> **Note**: This section demonstrates Continuous Deployment via ADO pipelines, which is equivalent to the Continuous Deployment via GitHub Actions demonstrated in Task 2. For this reason, disabling GitHub action here is critical so that both pipelines (ADO & GitHub Actions) don't interfere with each other.


1. In your GitHub navigate to `.github/workflows` directory, open `docker-publish.yml` and replace `branches: ...` with the following statement, and then commit the changes.

    ```pwsh
    on:
      push:
        branches-ignore:    # <-- Add this list property
         - '*'            # <-- with '*' to disable all branches
    ```
   It should look like this:
    
    ![Initial creation page for a new Azure DevOps Pipeline.](media/yml1.png "Azure DevOps Pipelines")
    
1. Navigate to your Azure DevOps `Fabrikam` project, select the `Project Settings` blade, and open the `Service Connections` tab.

   ![Initial creation page for a new Azure DevOps Pipeline.](media/image20.png "Azure DevOps Pipelines")
   
1. Click on **Create Service Connection**.

     ![Azure DevOps Pipeline Connections page where we associate the GitHub repository with this pipeline.](media/repo.png "Azure DevOps Pipeline Connections")

1. In the `Configure` tab, choose the `Starter Pipeline`.

    ![Initial creation page for a new Azure DevOps Pipeline.](media/starter.png "Azure DevOps Pipelines")

1. Remove all the steps from the YAML. The empty pipeline should look like the following:

    ```yaml
    # Starter pipeline
    # Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
    # Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
    # https://aka.ms/yaml

    trigger:
    - main

    pool:
      vmImage: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    ```

1. Click on **Show assistant** to view the side bar, find the `Docker Compose` task, and configure it with the following fields:

    - Container Registry Type: Container Registry
    - Docker Registry Service Connection: GitHub Container Registry (created in step 3)
    - Docker Compose File: **/docker-compose.yml
    - Additional Docker Compose Files: build.docker-compose.yml
    - Action: Build Service Images
    - Additional Image Tags = $(Build.BuildNumber)
    - Click on **Add**

    ![Docker Compose Task definition in the AzureDevOps pipeline.](media/hol-ex3-task3-step9-1.png "Docker Compose Task")
    
    ![](media/docker%20compose.png)

1. Repeat step 11 and add another `Docker Compose` task and configure it with the following fields:

    - Container Registry Type: Container Registry
    - Docker Registry Service Connection: GitHub Container Registry (created in step 3)
    - Docker Compose File: **/docker-compose.yml
    - Additional Docker Compose Files: build.docker-compose.yml
    - Action: Push Service Images
    - Additional Image Tags = $(Build.BuildNumber)
    - Click on **Add**

    ![](media/docker-composer-registry.png)
    
1. The final file should be similar like the below:
    
    ![Docker Compose Task definition in the AzureDevOps pipeline.](media/final1.png "Docker Compose Task")

1. Now click on Save and run from the right corner to run the build. New docker images will be built and pushed to the GitHub package registry.

    ![Run detail of the Azure DevOps pipeline previously created.](media/save%20and%20run.png "Build Pipeline Run detail")
    
1. On Save and run page, leave everything as default and click on **Save and run**.

     ![](media/save%20and%20run1.png)
     
1. You will be prompted with a Warning to grant permissions for the pipeline, click on **View**.

1. On Waiting for review page, click on **Permit** to grant permissions.

     ![](media/permit.png)

1. Navigate to your `Fabrikam` project in Azure DevOps and select the `Project Settings` blade. From there, select the `Service Connections` tab.

1. On **Service Conenctions** page, click on **New service connection**.

     ![](media/new%20service%20conenctions.png)
    
1. Select  `Azure Resource Manager` and click on **Next**.

1. On new service connection tab choose **Service Principal (manual)** and select **Next**

    ![Run detail of the Azure DevOps pipeline previously created.](media/image22.png "Build Pipeline Run detail")

1. Enter your subscription ID, Name and get the Service Principal details from **Environment Details -> Service Principal** details tab and then Service Connection name to **Fabrikam-Azure**. Value of Service Principal Id is the same as Application Id and Service Principal Key value is same as Secret key.
 
    >  **Note**: You can get subscription name from Azure portal -> Subscriptions

1. Navigate to Pipelines and select the pipeline you create in last step and click `Edit` mode, and then select the `Variables` button on the top-right corner of the pipeline editor. 

    ![Run detail of the Azure DevOps pipeline previously created.](media/image23.png "Build Pipeline Run detail")
    
    ![Run detail of the Azure DevOps pipeline previously created.](media/image24.png "Build Pipeline Run detail")

1. Add a secret variable `CR_PAT`, check the `Keep this value secret` checkbox, and copy the GitHub Personal Access Token from the Before the Hands-on lab guided instruction into the `Value` field. Save the pipeline variable - we will reference it in a later step.

    ![Adding a new Pipeline Variable to an existing Azure DevOps pipeline.](media/hol-ex3-task3-step15-1.png "New Pipeline Variable")

1. Modify the build pipeline YAML to split into a build stage and a deploy stage, as follows. Make sure to replace **arguments** value with **<inject key="Deploymentid" />**, once done save the pipeline.
 

    ```yaml
    # Starter pipeline
    # Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
    # Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
    # https://aka.ms/yaml
